Core Classes and Features
RecursiveFactorial:

Implements the factorial function in two ways: basic recursion and tail recursion.
Demonstrates efficient stack usage with the tail-recursive approach.
RecursiveFibonacci:

Provides methods for calculating Fibonacci numbers using basic, optimized, and tail-recursive approaches.
Includes additional utility functions to manipulate bit representations of numbers.
RecursiveStringReplace:

Recursively replaces all instances of a specific character in a string with another character.
Showcases string manipulation using recursion.
Count:

Implements recursive functions to count up and down between 1 and a given number.
Highlights simple recursion techniques for iteration.
Test Classes:

TestFactorial, TestFibonacci, and TestReplace validate the implementations with various test cases.
Help ensure the correctness of recursive logic.
TimeFibonacci:

Benchmarks the performance of the Fibonacci implementations, comparing basic, optimized, and tail-recursive approaches.
Demonstrates the impact of algorithmic efficiency on execution time.


Key Learning Outcomes
